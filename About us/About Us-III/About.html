        We’re a fully distributed team of 85 people living and working in 15
        countries around the world. And we’re working to build the best products
        to help our customers build their brands and grow their businesses on
        social media. <br />We’ve always aimed to do things a little differently
        at Buffer. Since the early days, we’ve had a focus on building one of
        the most unique and fulfilling workplaces by rethinking a lot of
        traditional practices.<br />
        A commitment to supporting our team and our customers has helped Buffer
        grow from humble beginnings to now serving more than 140,000 users. Our
        passion for making meaningful connections flows through everything we
        do.<br />
        We care about building a quality product, trusted relationships with our
        customers, and a sense of community that connects our customers and team
        with one another.<br />
        To learn more about our approach to business and work, feel free to hop
